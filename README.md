# Reading---Django-Models

**SQL databases** use structured query language and are best for structured data with defined relationships. They provide ACID compliance, which ensures transactional reliability. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, handle unstructured data and offer flexibility, scalability, and fast performance, making them suitable for large-scale data and real-time web applications.

**Object Relational Mapping (ORM)** is a technique that creates a bridge between object-oriented programming (OOP) and relational databases. ORM tools simplify database interactions by allowing developers to manipulate database data using OOP languages instead of SQL. These tools translate OOP methods into SQL queries, reducing the need for extensive SQL code. ORM tools are available for various languages, such as Hibernate for Java, Django and SQLAlchemy for Python, Laravel for PHP, and Entity Framework for .NET. They enhance development speed, security, and ease of use but can be challenging to learn and may not perform as well with complex queries. In Django, models define the structure and behavior of the data, mapping each model class to a database table, which allows developers to interact with the database using Python code instead of raw SQL.
